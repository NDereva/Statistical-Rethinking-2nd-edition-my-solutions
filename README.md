# Statistical-Rethinking-2nd-edition-my-solutions

In this project I try to reproduce the code from one [very nice book](https://www.amazon.com/Statistical-Rethinking-Bayesian-Examples-Chapman-dp-036713991X/dp/036713991X/ref=dp_ob_title_bk) about bayesian statistical modeling.

This project is created solely for eductional purposes. I find it easier to learn when I can play with the code. 
It is quite unlikely that you will find anything new or original here. 
However, there might be many bugs and errors. So be careful.
